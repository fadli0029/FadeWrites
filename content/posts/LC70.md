## Problem statement
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

__Example 1:__
> **Input:** n = 2  
> **Output:** 2  
> **Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.  
> 1. 1 step + 1 step  
> 2. 2 steps  

__Example 2:__
> **Input:** n = 3  
> **Output:** 3  
> **Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.  
> 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step  
> 2. 1 step + 2 steps  
> 3. 2 steps + 1 step

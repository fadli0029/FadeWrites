In this post, we solve leetcode problems in C++. The main goals are 3
1. To highlight the thought process to arrive at the solution.
2. To emphasize how we use techniques learned in our DSA post to solve these problems.
3. To show how to apply the common patterns in solving these problems.
4. To evaluate the time and space complexity of the solution and look for ways to optimize it.

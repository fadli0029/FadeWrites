In this post, I talk about iterators in C++, what they are, and the different types of iterators in C++.

Extremely useful resource is this stackoverflow post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51586495/what-is-an-iterator-in-general especially this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/51586634

Another very good resource is C++ Cookbook by Stephens et. al., Chapter 7.
